<=== Overview ===>

This repository contains several scripts that I have used to do time management
tasks. I plan to eventually incorporate them all into a single application, but
they are each experiements, some with mature development, other with minimal
development.

<=== Sub App Descriptions ===>
    - ctimer.pl: 
        This is a perl script that captures the pomodoro style time tracking.
