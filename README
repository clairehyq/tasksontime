<=== Overview ===>

This repository contains several scripts that I have used to do time management
tasks. I plan to eventually incorporate them all into a single application, but
they are each experiements, some with mature development and others with minimal
development.

<=== Sub App Descriptions ===>
    - ctimer.pl: 
        This is a perl script that captures the pomodoro style time tracking. 
    - timetracker:
        This application is focused on tracking time as it relates to
        roles/projects/tasks. It uses YAML input/output to file in order to
        store the data.

        - Notes on install, while in dev:
            - Install bundler:

                gem install bundler

            - Install Dependencies of bunderl
                
                bundle install
                
                - Note this required me to have the dev libs for ruby on my machine
            
            - Execute timetracker with:
                
                bundle exec bin/timetracker
